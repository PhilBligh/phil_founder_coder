# phil_founder_coder

Hello,

This website was created as my application for the Founders and Coders web development course. 
All code was written by me and no external libraries were used. My knowledge was gained through Codecademy and Free Code Camp courses, plus lots and lots of Googling!

Each section, including the nav bar is its own flexbox. I used flex for the ease of arranging the items within the flexbox to create a hopefully more tidy display. 

The 'Other Interests' and 'Links' section use DOM event listeners and DOM updates, in the case of 'Other Interests' to scroll through a photo gallery, and in the case of 'Links' to lower the opacity of the link image when the mouse hovers over it.

I hope this meets the requirements and I hope I might be hearing from you in the future.

Thanks for reading my appliation,

Phil
