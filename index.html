                <p>Welcome to my application website! I'm Phil, a father of two, currently working for the BBC as a news camera operator, filming and editing stories in the UK and around the world. I've been learning to code in my spare time for the last year or so and feel it's about time I turned this hobby into a career.</p>

            <div class="apply-text">
                <p>I discovered coding only recently and found an immediate affinity for it, enjoing the puzzle-like logic and engaging with the friendly online community. I've enjoyed becoming a student again, rediscovering a thirst for knowlegde and the joy of learning. I see so much potential in all of the skills I'm gaining, and see potential in myself for the first time in a long time. I have only ever had a 'job' but now I see the possibility of a 'career', one that could take me to so many exciting places, working with and learning from fascinating and knowledgable individuals. My skill-level remains basic however, and I feel I am limiting myself by learning alone. I hope to be accepted on the Founders and Coders course to take me to the next level, giving me the tools I need to implement a career change and find employment in the industry. The structure of an organised course would benefit me greatly, and the support of the instructors, and the community (which has already been of much help to me on Discord) would be invaluable.</p>
